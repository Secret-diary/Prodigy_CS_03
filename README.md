## Password Complexity Checker

   Passwords are alphanumeric strings used for user authentication. They're vital for protecting sensitive information and resources from unauthorized access. Strong passwords are long, complex, and unique. Good password practices include regular updates, avoiding common words, and using multi-factor authentication when possible. However, passwords can be vulnerable to various security risks, so it's crucial to remain vigilant and adopt secure password management practices.


## Overview


The Python script serves as a tool for assessing the strength of passwords entered by users. It evaluates the complexity of passwords based on several key factors, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters
